# Trivia-Game

## What is this?
This is a trivia game based on the Friends TV show. It's mobile responsive and should work on all screens sizes.

## Why is this useful?
This is useful for me to track my progress in my coding boot camp and remember some of the stuff I've done in the past. It may also be helpful to other new coders to see possible ways to do things.

## How to get started?
Follow the instructions on the screen when you load the game. You just have to click the button on the screen. It will cycle through all the questions one time. At the end you can start over by pressing the button that pops up again.

## Where to get help?
You can reach out to me diretly, but I make no claims as to how quickly I'll get back to you. The best bet is to just Google what you're stuck on. That's what I did to create this game. W3Schools, Mozilla's Develper Network, and Stack Overflow were really helpful resources.

## Maintence and contributions
This game may be periodically maintained by me and as of this writing, I'm the only contributor to it. My friend John helped with beta/QA testing of this as well.
